# beatify - Drum Machine

This project was built with React and SASS. It started out as [freeCodeCamp project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine), but since I have a background in audio engineering and music production, I wanted to expand the features of the app and added a step-sequencer and some additional functionality.  
The drum samples I used are from [808 Trapstep Vol. 2](https://trisamples.com/808-trapstep-pack-vol-2/).
All the icons I used are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

### Startup

You can run these commands from the project root:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
